# dryoc: Don't Roll Your Own Cryptoâ„¢[^1]

dryoc is a pure-Rust implementation of
[libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/), designed to be 100%
compatible with a interchangeable with the libsodium API, and have limited
dependencies.

Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV): Requires **Rust 1.51** or newer.

## Features

* 100% pure Rust
* mostly free of unsafe code[^2]
* free of corporate and governmental influence
* automatic safety features such as zeroization of data structures (via
  [Drop] and [Zeroize](https://crates.io/crates/zeroize))
* protected memory support, with an API designed such that it's hard to
  accidentally unprotect your memory
* designed to be especially difficult to use incorrectly[^3]
* provides full compatibility with libsodium, and implements most of its functions
* covers common use cases for safe encryption
* available under the [LGPL-3.0 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)

# APIs

This library includes both a _Classic_ API, which is very similar to the
original libsodium API, and _Rustaceous_ API with Rust-specific features.
Both APIs can be used together interchangeably, according to your
preferences. The Rustaceous API is a wrapper around the underlying classic
API.

It's recommended that you use the Rustaceous API unless you have strong
feelings about using the Classic API. The classic API includes some pitfalls
and traps that are also present in the original libsodium API, and unless
you're extra careful you could make mistakes. With the Rustaceous API, you'd
have to try really hard to do things wrong.

# Using Serde

This crate includes optional [Serde](https://serde.rs/) support which can be
enabled with the `serde` feature flag. When enabled, the
[`Serialize`](serde::ser::Serialize) and [`Deserialize`](serde::de::Deserialize)
traits are provided for data structures.

# Security notes

This crate has not been audited by any 3rd parties.

With that out of the way, the deterministic nature of cryptography and
extensive testing used in this crate means it's relatively safe to use,
provided the underlying algorithms remain safe. Arguably, this crate is
_incredibly_ safe (as far as cryptography libraries go) thanks to the
features of the Rustaceous API, and those provided by the Rust language.

[^1]: Not actually trademarked.

[^2]: The protected memory features described in [protected] require custom
memory allocation and system calls, which are unsafe in Rust.

[^3]: The Rustaceous API is designed to protect users of this library from
making mistakes, however the Classic API allows one to do as one pleases.

[^4]: Currently only available on nightly Rust, with the `nightly` feature flag enabled.
