//! # dryoc: Don't Roll Your Own Cryptoâ„¢[^1]
//!
//! dryoc is a pure-Rust, general purpose cryptography library. It's also an
//! implementation of [libsodium](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/), and designed to be 100%
//! compatible with a interchangeable with libsodium's API.
//!
//! Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV): Requires **Rust 1.51** or newer.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * 100% pure Rust
//! * mostly free of unsafe code[^2]
//! * free of corporate and governmental influence
//! * automatic safety features such as zeroization of data structures (via
//!   [Drop] and [Zeroize](https://crates.io/crates/zeroize))
//! * protected memory support, with an API designed such that it's hard to
//!   accidentally unprotect your memory
//! * designed to be especially difficult to use incorrectly[^3]
//! * provides full compatibility with libsodium, and implements most of its
//!   functions
//! * covers common use cases for safe encryption
//! * available under the [LGPL-3.0 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)
//!
//! # APIs
//!
//! This library includes both a _Classic_ API, which is very similar to the
//! original libsodium API, and _Rustaceous_ API with Rust-specific features.
//! Both APIs can be used together interchangeably, according to your
//! preferences. The Rustaceous API is a wrapper around the underlying classic
//! API.
//!
//! It's recommended that you use the Rustaceous API unless you have strong
//! feelings about using the Classic API. The classic API includes some pitfalls
//! and traps that are also present in the original libsodium API, and unless
//! you're extra careful you could make mistakes. With the Rustaceous API, it's
//! harder to make mistakes thanks to strict safety features.

//! # Using Serde
//!
//! This crate includes optional [Serde](https://serde.rs/) support which can be
//! enabled with the `serde` feature flag. When enabled, the
//! [`Serialize`](serde::ser::Serialize) and
//! [`Deserialize`](serde::de::Deserialize) traits are provided for data
//! structures.
//!
//! # Security notes
//!
//! This crate has not been audited by any 3rd parties.
//!
//! With that out of the way, the deterministic nature of cryptography and
//! extensive testing used in this crate means it's relatively safe to use,
//! provided the underlying algorithms remain safe. Arguably, this crate is
//! _incredibly_ safe (as far as cryptography libraries go) thanks to the
//! features provided by the API of this crate, and those provided by the Rust
//! language itself.
//!
//! [^1]: Not actually trademarked.
//!
//! [^2]: The protected memory features described in the [protected] mod require
//! custom memory allocation, system calls, and pointer arithmetic, which are
//! unsafe in Rust.
//!
//! [^3]: The Rustaceous API is designed to protect users of this library from
//! making mistakes, however the Classic API allows one to do as one pleases.
//!
//! [^4]: Currently only available on nightly Rust, with the `nightly` feature
//! flag enabled.
